# AULandingChromeBookmarks
Because Chrome doesn't do bookmarklets,  this Chrome Extension automagically adds bookmarks to the AU Landing service.

At the moment, it only submits bookmarks in COMP266, but options are coming shortly which will give you a list of groups you belong to in which to post bookmarks.  

ELGG is a bit persnickity about posting in groups. If you link to the generic add bookmark page, you can change the main group to your desired course, but none of the subfolders show up, so you have no choice but to submit to the Main folder.  Submitting with the course code URL is preferable.

# Installation

Download the zip and extract it in a permanent location
Go to chrome://extensions/ in your Chrome browser, turn on _Developer mode_ and _load unpacked extension_, choosing the folder with the extension files.
